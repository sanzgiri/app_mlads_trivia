# ChatGPT Jeopardy!

A Streamlit app to play Jeopardy!

## Game Modes
* Contestant vs JArchive (Default) - Questions are randomly pulled from JArchive and posed to Contestant
* Contestant vs ChatGPT - Questions are generated by ChatGPT and posed to Contestant
* ChatGPT vs Archive - Questions are pulled from JArchive and posed to ChatGPT
* ChatGPT vs World - Questions are input to ChatGPT from UI

## To Do (based on discussions with Alex Blanton)
* Show contestant name in app
* Set limit on number of questions for contestant (say 3) - rather than lives.
* First round: Contestant vs JArchive: 3 questions
* Second round: Contestant vs ChatGPT: 3 questions
* Maybe combine in same screen, so scores can be added?
* Final round: Contestant gets to ask ChatGPT 3 questions. ChatGPT points are inverse of contestant. Contestant gets points if ChatGPT answers incorrectly, loses points if ChatGPT answers correctly.

## To Do
* Allow changing LLM model between OpenAI model versions (for ChatGPT question generation and answering)
* Echo explanations from LangChain on UI rather than console
* Allow using Substrate API (rather than personal keys)
* Provide more control on Categories when questions are pulled from JArchive.
    * Allow selection of Categories
